When mentioning 'meaurse' or 'measurements' be mindful that there're different types of measurements
you could be measuring in milimeters or meters this is also refered to as Prefix Multipliers

/* Density Explanation 
	Density is mass in grams divided by cubic centimeter volume.
		Volume is a measure of space. 
			Height X Length X Width = Volume.
			Raise a unit by power of 3 it becomes a cubic Volume.
			1 milliliter equals 1 cubic centimeter.
		Mass is object is a measure of the quantity of matter.
			Be mindful that weight is object's gravitational pull.
			Mass is measured in grams.  
			Mass is extensive property, depends on amount of substance.
  		Density is a characteristic physical property of substances that depends on on temperature 
			Density is therefore a intensive property, one that is independent of the amount of a substance .
			Density of substance is the ratio of its mass (m) to its volume(V).
	if you don't understand density a common riddle is told to explain it.
		"Which weighs more, a ton of bricks or a ton of feathers?" 
			They both weigh the same! 
				if you say bricks yyou confused weight with density.
